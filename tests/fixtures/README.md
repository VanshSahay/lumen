# Test Fixtures

This directory contains known-good Ethereum mainnet data for testing.

## Files

- `block_header_*.json` — Real beacon chain block headers with their state roots
- `sync_committee_update_*.json` — Real light client updates with BLS signatures
- `account_proof_*.json` — Real eth_getProof responses for known accounts
- `storage_proof_*.json` — Real storage proofs for known contract slots

## How to Generate

Fixtures can be generated by querying public Ethereum APIs:

```bash
# Fetch a finalized checkpoint
curl https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/slot/finalized

# Fetch a light client update
curl https://beacon.api/eth/v1/beacon/light_client/updates?start_period=900&count=1

# Fetch an account proof
curl -X POST https://eth.llamarpc.com \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method":"eth_getProof","params":["0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe",[],"latest"]}'
```
